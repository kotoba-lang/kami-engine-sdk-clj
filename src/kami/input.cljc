(ns kami.input
  "L3 — data-first input action maps: a pure layer that turns a set of *held
  keys* into *action axes / events* via a declarative binding table.

  The native `kami-input` crate owns OS event capture (keyboard/mouse/touch/
  gamepad) + the FocusManager. This namespace owns only the *binding* layer:
    (action-axes held-keys binding-table) -> {axis-name float}
  It runs on tiny data (a held-key set + a small binding table), never
  per-element, so it is wasmi-safe to compile via kotoba-clj and run as
  CLJ→WASM on iOS/console (ADR-0040 / clj-wgsl-ledger Phase 1.2).

  Binding table shape:
    {:axes   [{:axis :move-x :positive :d :negative :a :scale 1.0}
              {:axis :move-y :positive :w :negative :s}]
     :actions #{:jump :fire}   ; any held key in this set → action active
     :triggers {:jump :space}} ; edge-triggered (handled via prev-held diff)

  Pure — no IO. A `defsystem` reads the host-held key set (a host import) and
  calls `action-axes` / `active-actions` / `triggered-actions` once per tick."
