(ns kami.fsm
  "L3 — data-first finite-state machine: a transition table + a pure `advance`
  walker. State is a keyword; transitions are `{:from :event :to :guard? :on-enter?}`
  rows. `advance` reduces over pending events and returns the new state + any
  emitted actions (from :on-enter hooks).

  This is the CLJC mirror of the per-frame FSM walkers the Rust `kami-game`
  crate used to hard-code. It runs on small config-shaped data (a transition
  table + a handful of pending events per entity per frame), never per-element,
  so it is wasmi-safe to compile via kotoba-clj and run as CLJ→WASM on
  iOS/console. The hot per-entity loop is the *host's* job (a `defsystem` that
  declares the query and dispatches `advance` once per entity, not an inner
  CLJ loop). See ADR-0040 / clj-wgsl-ledger Phase 1.2.

  Pure — no IO, no ECS, no GPU. A system threads `(world dt)` and calls
  `advance` per entity; this namespace only owns the table walker."
