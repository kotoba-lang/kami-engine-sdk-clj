(ns kami.schedule
  "L3 — system schedule: a *data* declaration of which systems run each tick, in
  what order, with what component query. Phase 2.4 of the clj-wgsl migration
  (ADR-2607010930).

  The core invariant: **CLJ authors the SCHEDULE as EDN; the host executes it.**
  A game declares `[{:system ident :order n :query #{component-keys} :events #{…}}]`
  and `run-schedule` threads the ECS `world` through each system in `:order`,
  handing each system fn only the entities matching its `:query` (via
  `kami.ecs/query`).

  **Coarse-grained by design (wasmi-safety).** The schedule runner iterates
  *per-system*, NEVER per-entity. A system fn receives the queried entity seq
  once and is expected to be O(1) in CLJ or dispatch the bulk buffer to
  WGSL/native compute — it must NOT loop per-entity in CLJ on the hot path
  (wasmi has no JIT; a per-entity CLJ loop is unsafe). This namespace only
  filters + threads; the per-entity work is the system fn's (or the GPU's)
  job. See ADR-2607010930 / ARCHITECTURE.md §10.

  Pure — no IO, no GPU, no atom. A schedule is plain data; `run-schedule` is a
  deterministic reduce over `world`. Additive over `kami.sim` (which owns the
  global `defsystem` registry + RAF loop); this namespace is the
  data-first surface for games that want to declare the schedule as a value
  rather than mutate the registry."

(defn schedule
  "Build a system schedule from a seq of spec maps. Each spec:

      {:system  <ident>           ; keyword identifying the system fn
       :order   <n>              ; sort key (default 0)
       :query   #{component-keys} ; entities handed to the fn possess ALL these
       :events  #{...}           ; optional, opaque to the runner — for the fn
       :fn      <f>              ; optional inline fn (see below)
       ...}

  `:fn` is optional: a spec may carry the system fn inline, or resolve it
  later via `resolve-fn` (default identity — specs that already contain :fn
  pass through). Returns a vector of resolved specs sorted by :order, each
  augmented with `:entities` lazily — NO, entities are resolved at run time
  against a world, not baked into the schedule. The schedule is plain data."

  Returns the final `world`. Pure: no atom, no IO. Systems that return nil are
  treated as identity (world unchanged) so a pure-observer system can simply
  read `entities` and return nil. The runner does NOT iterate `entities`
  itself — it hands the whole seq to `f` once; per-entity work is `f`'s job
  (and `f` is expected to be O(1) in CLJ or dispatch a bulk buffer to
  WGSL/native, not loop per-entity in CLJ on the hot path)."
