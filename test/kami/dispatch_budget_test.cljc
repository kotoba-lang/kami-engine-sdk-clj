  "Phase 3.3 — wasmi dispatch-budget invariant (ADR-2607010930).

  This test guards the wasmi no-JIT constraint at the CLJ tick layer. The
  structural hazard it pins: `kami.schedule/run-schedule` must dispatch
  per-system (coarse-grained), NEVER per-entity. Under wasmi — which has no
  JIT — a regression that makes the runner iterate per-entity would make every
  iOS/console CLJ-WASM tick O(N) in entity count: the host would call into CLJ
  once per entity per system per tick, blowing the frame budget as scenes grow.

  The correct shape (asserted here): for K ticks over a world with M entities
  matching a system's `:query`, the system fn is invoked exactly K times
  (once per tick) — NOT K×M times (once per entity per tick). Per-entity work
  is the system fn's job, which dispatches a bulk buffer to WGSL/native compute
  rather than looping per-entity in CLJ on the hot path. The runner hands the
  fn the whole queried entity seq each tick (batched); the fn's body, not the
  runner, decides what to do with it.

  See ADR-2607010930 Phase 3.3 and ARCHITECTURE.md §10. The single-tick
  coarse-grain is already pinned by `kami.schedule-test`; this namespace pins
  the multi-tick dispatch budget — the budget grows linearly with tick count,
  never with tick-count × entity-count."
